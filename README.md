# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of Scope of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to look at the employment trends of Pewlett Hackard and anticipate upcoming turnover made inevitable by the companies aging workforce. This analysis presents an opportunity to target unidentified employment needs, anticipate upcoming changes and strengthen existing employees.

## Key Results

Below we have identified 4 key results from our analysis:

### No. 1 An astounding level of Senior Engineers are eligible to retire

Not including those solely with the title "Engineer", our primary area of concern for those exiting the workforce is our Senior Engineers at 25,916 employees anticipated to retire. This could leave an astronomical gap in our workforce, and a massive need for experienced senior-level engineers.

### No. 2 Retiring management levels are not a concern

We were able to observe that, on the opposite end of the spectrum from Senior Engineers, we are only anticipating 2 individuals in a management capacity to be retiring. This demonstrates that this employee type does not need to be treated as top priority in regard to levels of turnover, rather more resources should be invested into our anticipated Engineer turnover. 

### No. 3 Ample level of mentors available

Based on our birth year parameters, we have a large number of employees who are eligible to be mentors. Does this mean they are all in senior positions? No. This inference is further explained in our next key takeaway.

### No 4. Implications for Quality of Mentorship

Although based on birth year we have an astounding candidate pool for mentors, this does not mean that all individuals are in positions where mentorship may prove to be needed. For instance, out of a total of 749 Engineers eligible to act in a mentor capacity, only 305 of those individuals are Senior Engineers. Quantity does not necessarily imply quality, and that is an important factor to keep in mind when structuring the mentorship programs.

## Summary

The below discussion will briefly summarize our findings and future implications for Pewlett Hackard based on the presented analysis.

### Roles to Fill

When the "silver tsunami" runs its course through the Pewlett Hackard talent pool, we can anticipate 72,458 roles will need to be filled.

### Mentorship Capabilities

Based off of our use of birth year, we only have 1,549 eligible mentors at Pewlett Hackard to try and train the new generation of talent, to combat a loss of 72,458 roles. Therefore, no there are not enough qualified retirement ready employees.

### Additional Useful Analysis

It may prove to be beneficial to change our requirements for eligible mentors. Rather than looking at birth year, counting total number of years at the company may offer more mentors even if they are not looking at retiring. Creating another query filtering by 'from_date' rather than 'birth_date' could prove to be useful. 

We may also find use in counting by title as we did previously for the employees we expect to retire. We can then see what mentors we have available per area of expertise. A manager is not going to mentor an engineer, therefore knowing specifics about training capabilities is crucial.
